Several utilities, written in python, to manipulate MR fiber data.

Requires;
  cython
  scipy
  numpy

This code now generates small (70x70) graphs that are consistent with 
the output of the MRCAP pipeline.  It also generates large graphs that
have 400-600K non-zero entries.

To generate biggrgaphs versus smallgraphs on must change the import option on
gengraph.py and choose from
  from fibergraph import FiberGraph
  from fibergraph_sm import FiberGraph
  
This should be made a command line option.

Requirements:
  - Python packages:
    - numpy
    - scipy
  - If you want to handle large files...
    - lots of ram (> 8GB)
    - 64-bit python

*** fiber.py
    Module for reading MRI Studio-format fiber files

*** printfibers.py
    Simple script to echo a fiber file out as text

*** fibgergraph.py
*** fibgergraph_sm.py
    Module to represent the graph derived from an MRI studio file

*** gengraph.py
    Script to generate a graph on a single MRI studio file

*** generate.py
    Call gengraph.py on directories of MRI studio files

*** roislice.py
    Displays the regions of interest in the brain as 2-d projections

*** zindex.pyx
    The Morton-order space filling curve.  To get the coordinates of a large
    graph identifier call zindex.MortonXYZ ( id ) which returns [ x, y, z ].
    This is a cython optimized version of the code and needs to be installed
    into your python distribution by calling 'python setup.py install'

*** setup.py
    Install the zindex package into your python distribution
