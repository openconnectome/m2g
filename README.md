[![GetBadges Game](https://openconnectome-m2g.getbadges.io/shield/company/openconnectome-m2g)](https://openconnectome-m2g.getbadges.io/?ref=shield-game)

m2g is a pipeline which takes as input Diffusion Weighted MRI (DTI) data, and produced structural connectomes (brain graphs) as a result.

For information about our pipeline, how to install it, and how to use it, head over to [our website](http://m2g.io)!

We are part of the bigger **Johns Hopkins University** Open Connectome project found [here](http://ocp.me/).
