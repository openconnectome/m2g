        <h2> Graphs may also be built programmatically </h2>
        The base url for building graphs is <pre>http://mrbrain.cs.jhu.edu/disa/upload/</pre>

        <h3> Single graph </h3>
        <p>
        The example <a href="https://github.com/openconnectome/MR-connectome/blob/master/MROCPdjango/examples/uploadsubj.py"
        target="blank"> uploadsubj.py</a> can be used as follows from a terminal session:
        </p>
        <code>python uploadsubj.py http://mrbrain.cs.jhu.edu/disa/upload/progmatic/site/subj/sess/scan/s YOUR_FIBER.dat YOUR_ROI.xml YOUR_ROI.raw -i cc,tri,ss1,mad,deg,eig</code>
        <p>
         The parameter after YOUR_scan can either be <code>s</code> or <code>b</code>, but not both. Using <code>s</code> or <code>small</code> builds a small graph
         (70 x 70 vertices) while <code>b</code> or <code>big</code> builds a big graph on the order of 10 M x 10 M vertices. <br/>

         The particular invocation in bold above would build a small graph and compute all invariants currently available. A list of invariant contractions is
         available below.
         <strong>The result of uploadsubj.py is a url containing all data produced. Simply wait for the http response and follow the url to download it.</strong>
         We recommend starting a <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" target="blank">tmux</a> or <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen" target="blank"> screen </a> session in case your processing time
         is lengthy.
        </p>

        The optional arguments given as <code>-i</code> are simply appended to the final url in uploadsubj.py. The options available must be in a comma separated list and are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li> <code>ss1</code> for the Scan Statistic 1</li>
          <li> <code>tri</code> for the Triangle Count </li>
          <li> <code>cc</code> for the Clustering Coefficient</li>
          <li> <code>mad</code> for the Maximum Average Degree</li>
          <li> <code>deg</code> for The Local Degree Count</li>
          <li> <code>eig</code> for the Top-k (100 or maximum available/computable) eigenvectors and eigenvalues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Multiple graphs </h3>
        <p>
        An example of a <a href="https://github.com/openconnectome/MR-connectome/blob/master/MROCPdjango/examples/upload_multi.py" target="blank">Multiple subject</a> job
        is also provided. This is as an example of how to process multiple jobs with a single programmatic call.<br/>

        From within a terminal/command line session, it can be used as follows: <br/>

        <code>python upload_multi.py http://mrbrain.cs.jhu.edu/disa/upload/YOUR_project/YOUR_site/YOUR_subject/YOUR_session s fiber_tract_dirctory roi_dirctory -i cc,tri,ss1,mad,deg,eig</code><br/>

        This call would build graphs for multiple scans and compute all invariants noted in the <code>-i</code> flag.
        The example assumes the following:

        <ul>
          <li>There is a directory containing all fiber tract files you wish to be processed with no other sub-directories or files you do not wish to process.</li>
          <li>There is a directory containing all corresponding roi files (i.e both an xml and raw file for each fiber tract file) with file names in accordance with the convention noted below.</li>
          <strong>Note the root of each roi file name should:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>End in <strong> _roi</strong> E.g filename_roi.xml and filename_roi.raw.</li>
              <li>
                Be identical to the root of its corresponding fiber tract file. E.g If the fiber tract file name is <strong> sample1.dat</strong>,
                then there must be a <strong>sample1_roi.raw</strong> AND a <strong> sample1_roi.xml</strong>. Thus the root is <strong>sample1</strong> in this example.
              </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        All fiber tract files  will be treated as a single project with multiple scanIDs derived from the file name.
        <a href="https://github.com/openconnectome/MR-connectome/blob/master/MROCPdjango/examples/upload_multi.py" target="blank">Download the file</a>
        and help can be obtained by typing the following in a terminal/command line session: <br/>
        <code>python upload_multi.py -h</code>. The same is true for the single scan example, where: <code>python uploadsubj.py -h</code> gives help.

           <h3>Specifications for graphs built</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> A <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/" target="blank">graphML</a> file formated graph. The format is readable by any xml-parser. </li>
              <li>It is also natively supported by the <a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/" target="blank">igraph</a> graph analysis framework in C, R and Python.</li>
              <li><b>NOTE: </b>Iterable data items are represented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> encoded strings as an extension to the graphML file format.</li>

          <h3>What's the difference between big and small graphs?</h3>
            <p>
              The terms big/small graph are particularly relevant to fiber streamline graphs. Small graphs are of dimension 70 x 70 vertices. <br/>
              Big graphs can be in the <b>millions</b> of vertices.
